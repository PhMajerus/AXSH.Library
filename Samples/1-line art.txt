
"1-line art.json" is a small collection of Unicode VT-art 1-liners
designed to render properly in a VT console using a font with
international extended ASCII such as "Lucida Console".

They make it easy and fun to experiment with the JSON format from
different scripting languages.
For example in JScript:
  var art = JSON.parse(load("C:\\path\\1-line art.json"));
  echo(art.mouse);
  for (var line in art) echo(line +" : "+ art[line] +"\r\n");
or in VBScript:
  LoadModule "C:\path\JSON.vbs"
  Set Art = JSON.Decode(Load("C:\path\1-line art.json"))
  Echo Art("mouse")
  For Each Line in Art: Echo Line &" : "& Art(Line) &vbCrLf: Next
or in PowerShell
  $art = Get-Content "C:\path\1-line art.json" | ConvertFrom-JSON
  $art
