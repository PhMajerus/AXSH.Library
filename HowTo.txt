
AXSH.Library for ActiveScript Shell
===================================

This archive has been downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/PhMajerus/AXSH.Library/.
It contains extra components, functions and modules for Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell, which must be installed separately from http://www.majerus.net/axsh/.

Create a folder named "Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell" in your Documents folder, such as "%UserProfile%\Documents\Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell\".
Then, copy the the content of this archive or folder into that folder.

ActiveScript Shell 2.0.8.0 or later will automatically load and parse functions from that library on their first call.

To read the ReadMe.ans, use the following statements depending on your language:
- JScript:
echo(ansi.loadAnsi(envVars.expand("%UserProfile%\\Documents\\Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell\\ReadMe.ans")));
- VBScript:
Echo ANSI.LoadAnsi(EnvVars.Expand("%UserProfile%\Documents\Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell\ReadMe.ans"))
