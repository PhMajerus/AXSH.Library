
AXSH.Library for ActiveScript Shell
===================================

This archive has been downloaded from GitHub
at https://github.com/PhMajerus/AXSH.Library/.
It contains extra functions for Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell, which must be
installed separately from http://www.majerus.net/axsh/.

Create a folder named "Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell" in your Documents
folder, such as "%UserProfile%\Documents\Majerus.net ActiveScript Shell\".
Then, copy the Functions folder from this archive into that folder.

ActiveScript Shell 2.0.8.0 or later will automatically load and parse
functions from that library on their first call.
